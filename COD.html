                    Call of Duty, also referred to as (COD), is a video game series and media franchise published by Activision, starting in 2003. 
                    The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. 
                    Several spin-off and handheld games were made by other developers. The most recent title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, was released on November 10, 2023.
                    The series originally focused on the World War II setting, with Infinity Ward developing Call of Duty (2003) and Call of Duty 2 (2005) and Treyarch developing Call of Duty 3 (2006). 
                    Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (2007) introduced a modern setting, and proved to be the breakthrough title for the series, creating the Modern Warfare sub-series; a Modern Warfare remastered version released in 2016. Two other entries, Modern Warfare 2 (2009) and Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made. 
                    The sub-series received a reboot with Modern Warfare in 2019, Modern Warfare II in 2022, and Modern Warfare III in 2023. 
                    Infinity Ward have also developed two games outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite Warfare (2016).
                    Treyarch made one last World War II-based game, World at War (2008), before releasing Black Ops (2010) and subsequently creating the Black Ops sub-series. 
                    Four other entries, Black Ops II (2012), Black Ops III (2015), Black Ops 4 (2018), and Cold War (2020) were made, the latter in conjunction with Raven Software.
                    Sledgehammer Games, who were co-developers for Modern Warfare 3, have also developed three titles, Advanced Warfare (2014), Call of Duty: WWII (2017), and Vanguard (2021). 
                    They are also the lead developer for Modern Warfare III (2023), the third entry in the Modern Warfare reboot sub-series.
                    As of April 2021, Call of Duty has sold over 400 million copies.
                    The series is verified by the Guinness World Records as the best-selling first-person shooter game series.
                    It is also the most successful video game franchise created in the United States and the fourth best-selling video game franchise of all time. 
                    Other products in the franchise include a line of action figures designed by Plan B Toys, a card game created by Upper Deck Company, Mega Bloks sets by Mega Brands, and a comic book miniseries published by WildStorm Productions, and a feature film in development.
